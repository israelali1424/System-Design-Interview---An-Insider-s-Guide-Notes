Chapter 13 was hard to understand


According to chapt gpt this  the tone I use for chapter 11: 

The tone of the notes from chapter 11 of the system design interview is informative and detailed. It appears to be written from an authoritative perspective, likely by an expert in the field, in order to provide a comprehensive understanding of a specific topic - in this case, the design of a news feed system.

The format is structured and logical, with a clear progression from clarifying questions, through high-level design and into a deeper dive of the design aspects. The information is presented in clear, concise sections, each labeled with a specific topic. There's also a use of visual aids, such as diagrams and images, to support the textual content and provide visual representations of the described systems.

I like notes that is in this tone. In order to get more notes in this tone more consisnilty with using mutipel promt I ask chapt gpt the following "Turn this into a prompt I can use for you help get notes like this for other chapteers" " also have promt make sure defentions are include as well" and "put the notes in markdown format so I can copy to an md file"
